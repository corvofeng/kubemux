A tmux wrapper for managing multiple clusters and incorporating [tmuxinator](https://github.com/tmuxinator/tmuxinator).

For this project, I heavily relied on ChatGPT, mainly for writing the logic and unit tests. Originally, I thought it would take 2-3 days of work, but the development cycle was shortened to 1 day. The final result is also very good. After rewriting, kubemux has no dependencies and is very lightweight to install.

The project is open source here, and it should be compatible with tmuxinator configurations. If you find any missing features, feel free to open an issue.
